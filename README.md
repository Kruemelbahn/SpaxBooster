# SpaxBooster

SpaxBooster (originally developed by FREMO) is a simple DCC-Booster controlled via LocoNET.<br>
Because I missed an acoustic and optical sign on overload, I made some small additions (including a 'new' PCB).

For more details please refer to the [manual](https://github.com/Kruemelbahn/Servo/Spaxbooster V3 - Rev.5.pdf).<br>
