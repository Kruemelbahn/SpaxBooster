# SpaxBooster

SpaxBooster (originally developed by FREMO) is a simple DCC-Booster controlled via LocoNET.<br>
Because I missed an acoustic and optical sign on overload, I made some small additions (including a 'new' PCB).

For more details please refer to the [manual](Documentation/Spaxbooster%20V3%20-%20Rev.6.pdf).<br>

## New for V3.0 Rev.6a
- Pin header for emergency stop (S2) combined with pin header K3

## New for V3.0 Rev.6
- R4 removed (must!)
- Emergency-stop added (R12 must! Button is optional)
- CDE-Interface added (optional)
